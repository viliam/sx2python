In high school, I enrolled in a course on programming in Assembler. On the first day, the teacher told us: 'With Assembler, you can earn millions—or nothing. It's unlikely that Intel will hire you to design new CPU processors, so the 'nothing' is probably your path.’

With syntax and semantic analysis, the situation is similar. It's perhaps even less likely that you'll design a new language that the market will accept and adopt.

So why am I reopening my thesis and reworking it? Maybe because it makes me happy—and yes, I do have fun. That could be it. But the answer is different and simpler: knowledge. By rewriting my thesis code in a new language, I can prove to myself (and to potential clients) that I have a deep understanding of the language and can solve complex problems with it.

How can you become more familiar with a language like Python than by writing a syntax analyzer in Python—for Python? Next steps would be Kotlin and GoLang.
